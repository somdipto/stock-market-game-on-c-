Getting Started
To run this game, you'll need a C compiler and a basic understanding of C programming. Here's how to get started:

Clone the repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/somdipto/stock-market-game-on-c-.git

Compile the code:

Navigate to the cloned directory and compile the source code using your preferred C compiler. Here's an example using GCC:

Bash
cd stock-market-game-on-c
gcc main.c -o stock_market_game
Use code with caution.
This will create an executable file named stock_market_game.

Run the game:

Bash
./stock_market_game
Use code with caution.
Gameplay
The game will simulate a stock market with a set of companies and their stock prices. You'll start with a certain amount of money and be able to buy and sell stocks throughout the game. The goal is to make as much money as possible by strategically buying and selling stocks based on their price fluctuations.

The specific gameplay mechanics, like the number of companies, initial capital, and price changes, might need to be configured in the source code (main.c).
